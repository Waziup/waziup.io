## URBANE: One Health Approach to Support Agroecological Transformation of Peri-Urban Farming.

**About the project:** URBANE is an important and innovative project that addresses the challenge of sustainable agriculture for food and nutrition security in peri-urban areas of low and middle-income countries. 
The project's focus on applying a One Health approach to address issues related to peri-urban agriculture is crucial, especially as urbanization continues to increase 
worldwide.

It is commendable that URBANE is built on the principles of agroecology, which promotes the integration of ecological, social, and economic aspects of agriculture. 
This approach can help to address the concerns about zoonotic diseases, sanitary issues, local environmental degradation, and antimicrobial resistance that are 
associated with the intensification of peri-urban agriculture.

The project's focus on demonstrating its approach through six case studies in Africa and facilitating its transferability to other regions is also commendable. 
It is essential to develop new and adapted business models that are informed by local specificities to ensure the sustainability and scalability of the project.

Overall, URBANE is an important initiative that can contribute to sustainable agriculture and food security in peri-urban areas of low and middle-income countries, 
while addressing the health risks associated with the intensification of food systems.
