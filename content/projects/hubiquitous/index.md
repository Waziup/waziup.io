WAZIUP is a non-profit organization that is dedicated to supporting African entrepreneurs and innovators in developing solutions that leverage Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to address local challenges in various fields such as agriculture, health, and energy. One of the exciting initiatives that WAZIUP is currently working on is the Hubiquitous project, which aims to create an integrated platform for managing and deploying IoT solutions across multiple domains.


The Hubiquitous project is an ambitious undertaking, with the goal of enabling local entrepreneurs and developers in Africa to quickly and easily deploy their own IoT solutions. The platform is designed to be highly scalable and customizable, which is critical for deploying IoT solutions in resource-constrained environments. With Hubiquitous, entrepreneurs and developers will be able to leverage a wide range of devices and sensors, including low-power devices and mobile sensors, to create IoT solutions that are tailored to their specific needs.

One of the key features of the Hubiquitous platform is its focus on interoperability. This means that devices and sensors from different vendors can work together seamlessly, without any compatibility issues. Interoperability is a critical feature for deploying IoT solutions at scale, as it enables developers to use a wide range of devices and sensors, without being constrained by the limitations of any particular vendor.

The Hubiquitous platform is being developed in collaboration with several partners, including academic institutions and private sector companies, both in Europe and Africa. This partnership is critical for ensuring that the platform is designed with the needs of local communities in mind. By working closely with local communities and leveraging their expertise, the Hubiquitous platform will be able to provide solutions that are tailored to the specific needs of these communities.

The Hubiquitous project has the potential to have a significant impact on the development of IoT solutions in Africa. By providing a robust and scalable platform that can be easily customized to meet the needs of local communities, the platform will enable local entrepreneurs and developers to create innovative IoT solutions that can address local challenges in various domains. Furthermore, by focusing on interoperability, the platform will enable developers to leverage a wide range of devices and sensors, which will further accelerate the development of IoT solutions in Africa.




In conclusion, the Hubiquitous project is an exciting initiative that is being developed by WAZIUP, in collaboration with several partners, to create an integrated platform for managing and deploying IoT solutions across multiple domains. By focusing on scalability, customization, and interoperability, the platform has the potential to enable local entrepreneurs and developers to create innovative IoT solutions that can address local challenges in various fields. With its focus on local communities and partnership with academic institutions and private sector companies, the Hubiquitous project is poised to have a significant impact on the development of IoT solutions in Africa.
