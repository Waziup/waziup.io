## Empowering innovative startup ecosystems through collaboration of Africa & European Digital Innovation Hubs

**About the project:** HUBiquitous is an Innovation Action aiming at creating a joint Africa-Europe Startup & Innovation Ecosystem for long-term collaborations and partnerships. The project has the ambition to increase the technology level and capacity building of 30 local Digital Innovation  Hubs (DIHs)/TechHubs in 5 African countries.


The project proposes highly innovative concepts called Innovation Enablers (i.e. Solution Lab, Application Business Box and MeetHub online platform). The purpose of these enablers is to provide technical (e.g. IoT, AI and BigData disruptive technologies) as well as entrepreneurial development skills to DIHs and startups/entrepreneurs. Thanks to these Innovation Enablers, the project will further demonstrate and build the local innovation capacity through 3 programs: (i) Talent program, building digital skills for local talents, (ii) Accelerator program, creating innovative applications and services and (iii) Community program, developing the Africa-Europe start-up and innovation communities. HUBiquitous Innovation Enablers and Programs will therefore support and empower the startup and entrepreneurship ecosystems from both continents with the development of a rich and sustainable collaboration between African and European DIHs.

**Talent Program** HUBiquitous’ Talent Program  will improve the technical skills of the African tech-communities/professionals in order to increase the innovation capacity of the local ecosystem. At the same time, it will enhance the employment and job opportunities within the communities. The program will focus especially on youth (17-35 years old), also taking into account women and marginalized groups. The Talent Program will be highly appealing for local developers, system architects, engineers, ICT professionals and tech entrepreneurs who want to improve their skills and knowledge of disruptive technologies, such as IoT, Big data and AI. From our previous experience, we recognize that African technical communities need more hands-on training on hardware and software, especially on electronics and communication technologies. Therefore, the Talent Program will strongly focus on practical training (e.g, prototyping and developing using the resources of the Solution Lab facilities). The program will also include the design-thinking training to improve innovative product and application design skills.

**Accelerator Program** The Accelerator Program will support a total of least 50 innovative application solutions through two open calls during the course of the project. Each round we select the 25 most talented ideas to be part of a six-month program, in which the selected innovators will develop its idea/solution (concept prototype, MVP). After the selection process, the entrepreneurs will receive an application business box provided by the HUBiquitous project. The entrepreneurs will get access to the facilities of the Solution Lab for prototyping and testing. During the six-month program, the entrepreneurs will also receive the design-thinking guidelines, entrepreneurial coaching, and support from the project partners as well as from external mentors(coming from the DIHs and ESN’s network)

**Community Program** One of the main objectives of HUBiquitous is the long-term sustainability of the project results and activities. The sustainable uptake of the project’s innovation enablers and programs is intrinsically linked to the spirit and engagement of local, national and cross-continental communities and ecosystems. To achieve this, HUBiquitous’ vision is to build Africa-Europe Innovation Communities engaging DIHs, startups & entrepreneurs, SMEs/industries, incubator/accelerator, Diasporas, youth and women communities.
