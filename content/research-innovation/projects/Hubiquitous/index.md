## Empowering innovative startup ecosystems through collaboration of Africa & European Digital Innovation Hubs

HUBiquitous is an Innovation Action aiming at creating a joint Africa-Europe Startup & Innovation Ecosystem for long-term collaborations and partnerships. The project has the ambition to increase the technology level and capacity building of 30 local Digital Innovation  Hubs (DIHs)/TechHubs in 5 African countries.
The project proposes highly innovative concepts called Innovation Enablers (i.e. Solution Lab, Application Business Box and MeetHub online platform). The purpose of these enablers is to provide technical (e.g. IoT, AI and BigData disruptive technologies) as well as entrepreneurial development skills to DIHs and startups/entrepreneurs. Thanks to these Innovation Enablers, the project will further demonstrate and build the local innovation capacity through 3 programs: (i) Talent program, building digital skills for local talents, (ii) Accelerator program, creating innovative applications and services and (iii) Community program, developing the Africa-Europe start-up and innovation communities.

**Talent Program:**
HUBiquitous Talent Program improves the technical skills of the African tech-communities and enhances the employment and job opportunities. The focus is on the youth communities (17 â€“ 35 years old) taking into consideration women and marginalized groups.

**Accelator Program:**
The Accelerator Program supports entrepreneurs with the creation of new products and services in collaboration with European and African DIHs/TechHubs. It aims to improve the innovation creation capacity for entrepreneurs and start-ups, support the African-EU joint innovation project ideas and ventures and increase investment opportunities in African start-ups.

**Community Program:**
The Community Program aims to build Africa-Europe Innovation Communities engaging DIHs, start-ups & entrepreneurs, SMEs/industries, incubators and accelerators, diasporas, youth and women communities.
