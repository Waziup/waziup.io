## Empowering VET Institutions with Cutting-edge Skills
Kenya and Tanzania have made strides in bridging the industry-academia gap by adopting the Competency-Based Education and Training (CBET) curriculum in VET centers. CBET emphasizes industry-relevant skills, addressing youth unemployment. While it has shown positive outcomes, challenges remain, including curriculum design and technology adaptation. The 2013 VET Act allows local centers to create responsive training programs to meet market needs. The VocalizeIoT project supports these efforts by introducing IoT training, equipping students with crucial, adaptable skills for the digital age.

### Mission
VocalizeIoT aims to strengthen initiatives of VET centers by introducing specialized skills in IoT in a simple and easily adaptable fashion. This aligns with the VET act of 2013 in both Kenya and Tanzania for instance, which allows VET centers to develop their own training and award programs, enabling them to quickly adapt to emerging trends and upskill their students with new industry-specific technologies.

### Overall Concept
The VocalizeIoT concept is to build the capacity of the VET centers, in order to be more aligned with the
private and public sector needs and opportunities. As can be seen in the following Figure, the project
will prepare a complete package for VET capacity building, including three assets:
1. the VET Hybrid Solution Lab,
2. the VET capacity building,
3. the VET learner curriculum.

The final objective of the project is to develop the IoT skills for youth employment in emerging technical
fields such as IoT.
