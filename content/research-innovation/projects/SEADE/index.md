## Strengthening the Europe-Africa Digital Ecosystem Through Increased R&I Cooperation

The project SEADE – short for ‘Strengthening the Europe-Africa Digital Ecosystem Through Increased R&I Cooperation’ provides fundamental support services and route-to-market programmes for AU & EU Research and Innovation actors based on user-centred market research. The project, funded by the EU’s key funding programme for research and innovation, Horizon Europe, will be running for two years until December 2025.

### Vision
SEADE  vision is to provide R&IID actors with a comprehensive and smooth Route-to-Market pathway to support increased market uptake of applied research and digital transformation solutions.


### Project Overview
Running from 2024 to 2025, SEADA seeks to address the digital divide and support sustainable development through strategic R&I partnerships. The project operates by establishing collaborative frameworks and fostering connections between researchers, innovators, and policymakers across both continents. By leveraging these connections, SEADA intends to facilitate the transition of research outcomes into practical, market-ready solutions that can drive economic and social progress.

### Key Objectives
The SEADA project has several core objectives:

1. **Enhancing Digital Competence:** By providing resources and training, SEADA aims to elevate the digital skills of stakeholders in both Europe and Africa, ensuring they are well-equipped to participate in the global digital economy.
2. **Strengthening R&I Cooperation:** The project emphasizes building robust networks between European and African R&I communities. This includes collaborative research projects, shared innovation platforms, and joint ventures that address common challenges.
3. **Promoting Sustainable Development:** SEADA aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly focusing on reducing inequalities, promoting sustainable industrialization, and fostering innovation.
4. **Facilitating Market Transition:** A key component of SEADA is to help bridge the gap between research and commercialization. The project provides pathways for innovations to move from the lab to the marketplace, thus ensuring that research efforts translate into tangible economic benefits.
