- Integrate solar power management for full energy autonomy.
- Enable local access to the irrigation application by using the Edge irrigation controller as a hotspot, eliminating the need for a permanent internet connection.
- Ensure data privacy by design and use the LoRaWAN radio protocol for communication.
- Deploy the OSIRRIS platform using the Edge-capable gateway developed by Waziup e.V.
- Employ a technical-economic approach to drive research activities, integrating hydraulic, agro-economic, technological, and environmental aspects.
- Pilot and validate the full system in four test sites in Tunisia, aiming to achieve a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 6-7.

## Pilot

In order to properly train the AI models, we will perform a data collection campaign. This campaign will use Waziup tensiometers together with commercial Tensiometers with dataloggers for the pilot.
The good management of the use of irrigation water and the conservation of water resources, especially in the context of the current global warming which enormously affects the southern part of the Mediterranean basin, which is one of the most important and urgent subjects for the community who is interested in the sustainability of resources. OSSIRIS will contribute to these efforts.

In addition, this new technology (OSSIRIS platform) allows farmers controlled, easy and precise the irrigation. In this context, the data collection is important to estimate the real needs of the plant, to fix a scheduling irrigation program and prepare the output data for OSSIRIS platform. OSSIRIS platform will provide an efficient use of irrigation water for each type of crop that saving water resource. Also, it will improve yield and fruit quality, assure food security. The pilot will be deployed in two sites each having two to five sensors per site.The duration for the pilot will be run for a duration of three to six months.
