<!-- ![image](ideation.png) -->

We are proud to present the HUBiquitous project magazine, a comprehensive look at how Africa is embracing digital transformation through local innovation and entrepreneurship. This magazine highlights the incredible work of young African talents, Digital Innovation Hubs (DIHs), and tech entrepreneurs who are driving growth and change with cutting-edge technologies like IoT and AI.

From 2021 to 2024, HUBiquitous worked with over 30 DIHs across Africa, offering comprehensive training, immersive workshops, and collaborative programs that have empowered tech hubs to elevate their capabilities. The magazine covers key milestones of the project, including the success of our TechHub Catalyst Program, which helped 15 leading hubs from 13 countries build advanced technical skills, and our IoT Certification Program, which certified over 250 students in the latest digital technologies.

Inside, youâ€™ll also find stories about the HUBiquitous Innovation Week in Europe, where successful tech hubs showcased their achievements, and thought leadership on how to foster sustainable services and long-term growth in African tech ecosystems.

Whether you're interested in digital innovation, tech startups, or building sustainable ecosystems, this magazine offers invaluable insights and lessons learned from our journey. Download the magazine now to explore how HUBiquitous is shaping Africa's future in tech, creating opportunities for young entrepreneurs, and fostering partnerships that will continue to impact local communities for years to come.
