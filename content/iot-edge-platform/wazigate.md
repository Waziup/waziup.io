Waziup has developed Raspberry Pi HATs (WaziHAT) that add more capabilities to the Raspberry Pi including LoRa connectivity, control buttons, smart fan, OLED display and a blackout protection circuit. A combination of a WaziHAT, a raspberry pi and Wazigate Firmware is called WaziGate.

WaziGate can control actuators on field devices, such as electro-valves and host applications directly from the gateway. It can easily work without Internet connectivity and still provide data to end-users through its embedded database and web-based visualization module. WaziGate comes with fully edge computing features. WaziGate also includes the AI framework to run AI applications. 

**Features:**

- Edge capacity to host your applications
- LoRa communication up to 10-12 Km
- Permanent Wifi hotspot
- Wifi/3G/Ethernet internet connection
- Data upload with HTTP, MQTT or even SMS.
- Low power consumption
- Automation
- Remote management
