WAZIUP e. V. attended the Alliance High School 3rd Annual Computing and Robotics Fair 2023 held on the Saturday of 17th June 2023. 
The innovation event focused on Internet of Things (IoT) solutions to petty theft cases which have been a challenge in most High schools and Universities in Kenya. WAZIUP e. V. 
awarded the winners of the event with 5 of its latest prototyping kits and demonstrated a related real-world solution to the theme of the project. The organization is also working to install a dedicated gateway 
in the school where students can periodically use to develop their projects. A summary of one of the key projects - HUBiquitous – which seeks to empower African innovations and create a linkage to European – led startups 
was also presented. Overall, the participants were excited about the opportunities and were eager to learn more and utilize the provided resources.
