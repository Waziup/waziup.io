We are very excited to announce the launch of the community forum on WAZIUP website. The forum is a space where makers, developers, and entrepreneurs can:
- give feedback and share hacks on the WaziDev, WaziGate and Cloud Platform
- share their challenges and get support from our experts
- be informed about new software release and other announcements

This forum is also an opportunity to build a network of engaged makers who share experiences on the IoT ecosystem in Africa.
