The SEADE project officially launched the Softlanding Mission, marking the second stage of its “Route to Market” program. This three-month initiative is designed to empower digital innovators from Tanzania and Europe to access and align with market opportunities in Kenya through a structured blend of training, mentorship, and targeted industry engagement.

Following the successful Digital Youth Training Program (DYTP), the Softlanding Mission brings together **ten innovation teams from Tanzania and Kenya and two from Reutlingen University in Germany**, all working on Internet of Things (IoT) solutions with potential for deployment in Kenyan industries. The participants will undergo intensive training on product preparation, market analysis, industry alignment, and solution refinement.

Each stage of the program will be delivered virtually in weekly sessions and will cover core themes such as product design, pitching to industry, and aligning solutions to real market needs. Participants will also have access to Waziup Solution Boxes to explore integration of Waziup technologies. Select external experts will guide innovators on key topics such as funding, IP, business registration, and commercialization strategies.

The Softlanding program will culminate in a **Learning Expedition** during which innovators will travel to Kenya to engage directly with industry stakeholders, conduct gap analyses, and evaluate how well their solutions meet market expectations.
