The SEADE AIoT Route to Market Program successfully concluded its final stage,  the Learning Expedition (LEX),  held in Nairobi, Kenya from 25th to 29th August 2025.
The Learning Expedition brought together innovators from Kenya, Tanzania, and Europe, providing them with a unique opportunity to deepen their market understanding, test their solutions in real-world environments, and build strong industry linkages. This marked the culmination of months of training and industry engagement under the SoftLanding Mission, moving participants one step closer to market readiness.

### Activities and Highlights
The week-long program combined industry exposure, peer learning, and cultural exchange. Participants engaged in:

- Industry visits to leading organizations such as Konza Technopolis (Smart City), ICIPE - International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (Smart Farming), Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) (Smart Livestock Tracking), Tatu City & Tilisi Developments PLC Homes (Smart Homes), and Nairobi Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (NaMATA) (Smart Transport).
- Keynotes, workshops, and peer presentations where innovators shared their projects, received feedback, and refined their strategies.
- Networking opportunities with industry experts and local stakeholders to explore potential partnerships.
- A cultural city tour and gala dinner, fostering collaboration and celebrating the achievements of the cohort.


### Importance and Benefits
The Learning Expedition served as a crucial bridge between innovation and industry. Innovators not only gained first-hand insights into the challenges and opportunities in key Kenyan markets but also tested the applicability of their AIoT solutions across sectors such as agriculture, water, energy, and smart cities. By engaging directly with industry players, participants were able to refine their solutions, explore new opportunities for scaling, and strengthen their entrepreneurial journey. The innovators will now move forward to piloting their solutions with industry partners, turning insights from the Learning Expedition into real-world impact.

### Acknowledgment
This milestone would not have been possible without the invaluable support ofthe SEADE consortium, EldoHub, Association of African Universities (AAU), ENRICH in Africa - EiA and our host organizations across Kenya. Their commitment ensured that innovators had access to knowledge, mentorship, and market linkages critical for success.
As the program concludes, the innovators leave empowered with stronger networks, practical experience, and actionable strategies to transition their AIoT innovations into impactful, market-ready solutions.
