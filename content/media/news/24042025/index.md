The **Urbane Project** is accelerating smart agriculture across Africa with recent successful **IoT installations** in **Nigeria and Benin**, reinforcing its mission to empower smallholder farmers with real-time data for better decision-making.

During the latest field mission, the team deployed weather stations, solar-powered gateways, and tensiometers across four farms, working closely with local academic partners. In Nigeria, the project collaborated with Prof. Victor Adetimirin of the University of Ibadan, equipping Y Worry and Aberteen Farms with fully operational devices now transmitting data to the cloud.

In Benin, with support from **Prof. Kifouli Adeoti** of **Université d'Abomey-Calavi**, technical upgrades were completed at Akassato Farm, and a new system was configured at Sèmè-Kpodji Farm, currently awaiting a final gateway component to go live.

Despite minor challenges such as site access and firmware updates, the deployments were successfully completed and mark a significant step forward in enabling climate-smart, tech-enabled farming. These efforts lay the groundwork for expanded data collection and adaptive agriculture practices across the region.

Stay tuned as Urbane continues to scale its impact across Africa.
