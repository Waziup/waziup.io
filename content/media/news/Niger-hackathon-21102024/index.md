The **Agri_Hack Hackathon** held from October 21 to October 25 in Niger concluded with great success, bringing forward IoT-powered solutions to shape the future of agriculture in the region. Organized by **L’incubateur CIPMEN** as part of the **RETO-DOSSO Project**, the hackathon was backed by Waziup technology and the [WaziLab](lab.waziup.io) platform. This event fostered collaboration among participants and experts from Germany, Kenya, and Niger to address pressing agricultural challenges through technology and innovation.

The RETO-DOSSO Project aims to demonstrate how solar systems can not only improve water, electricity, and food supply in rural areas but also boost local economies and create viable business models for local investors. By piloting a solar-powered system at a village school in Niger’s Dosso region, RETO-DOSSO seeks to power a groundwater pump, enable irrigation, and provide electricity for local businesses, building a foundation for community resilience and economic growth.

The hackathon, supported by Solomon Githu from the Waziup team in Kenya, brought together participants for five intensive days of hands-on IoT learning, project development, and innovative problem-solving. Together, they explored solutions for precision agriculture, aiming to make farming practices more resilient and efficient through data and IoT applications.

This event also laid the groundwork for establishing a Living Lab in the Dosso region. In line with UNU and other RETO-DOSSO initiatives, the Living Lab will enhance water resource management, implement early project findings, and encourage youth to pursue careers in agriculture and agri-entrepreneurship.

The Agri_Hack Hackathon was an inspiring collaboration among enthusiastic participants, skilled trainers, and dedicated partners, all committed to transforming agriculture for a sustainable future. Special thanks go to everyone involved for making this event a powerful step toward a resilient, connected farming community in Niger.
