The significance of this collaboration lies in the collective efforts of digital innovation hubs across Europe and Africa, coming together to pool their expertise and experiences. By sharing best practices, 
these hubs aim to create a fertile ground for the development and implementation of disruptive technologies that can drive digitalization and bring about significant societal and economic changes.


Through the DIGILOGIC project, the participating hubs are not only exchanging knowledge but also forging strong partnerships that will enable them to address shared challenges and leverage each other's strengths.
