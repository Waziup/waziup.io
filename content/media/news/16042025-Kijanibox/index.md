The first-ever **KijaniBox Stakeholder Validation Workshop** was successfully held on **Kampala, April 15, 2025**  at Silver Springs Hotel, bringing together a dynamic mix of stakeholders to validate the findings of the recently conducted user-centric survey and discuss the future of green energy in Uganda.

Hosted by **Biogas Solutions Uganda Ltd (BSUL)** in partnership with the KijaniBox Consortium, the workshop served as a vital step toward the development of a biogas-powered cooling system tailored for Uganda’s agriculture and market environments.

### A Cross-Sectoral Gathering
The event welcomed a wide range of participants including:
- Dairy farmers and agro-processing officials

### Unveiling the Survey Findings
A key milestone during the event was the presentation of the survey report findings, which collected feedback from end-users across the dairy, market, and agro-processing sectors. The data validated the urgent need for decentralized cooling solutions powered by renewable energy.
