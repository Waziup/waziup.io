A collaborative workshop, jointly organized by IEEE Dedan Kimathi University Student Branch, IEEE PES DeKUT Branch, IEEE Women in Engineering, IEEE Photonics Society, IEEE Circuits and Systems Society (CASS) Kenya, 
TinyML Kenya community, and Waziup, proved to be a transformative experience for developers seeking to enhance their skills in circuit design, IoT, and TinyML. 
The workshop, held with the objective of equipping participants with essential knowledge and practical insights, garnered significant attention and participation.


Led by Waziup, renowned for its expertise in the Internet of Things (IoT), the workshop encompassed a series of comprehensive sessions. The engagement commenced with an illuminating webinar on Thursday, June 8,
which provided an introductory overview of IoT, LoRa, and Waziup technologies. This webinar set the foundation for the subsequent hands-on workshop conducted on June 10, 2023.


During the workshop, participants delved into the fundamentals of IoT while receiving training on the utilization of Waziup Technologies. The immersive learning experience began with instruction on how to transmit data
from the WaziDev device to a synchronized WaziGate, thereby establishing a functional connection to a WaziCloud account. The practical applications were further enhanced through the use of a web application that showcased 
real-time sensor values obtained from the WaziCloud.


By actively participating in this workshop, developers gained valuable insights into circuit design principles, along with a solid understanding of IoT and TinyML.
The collaborative efforts of the organizing entities, including Waziup, IEEE branches, and technology communities, played a pivotal role in fostering a dynamic learning environment and enabling participants#
to acquire essential skills and knowledge in these cutting-edge domains. The workshop served as a testament to the power of collaboration and knowledge-sharing in empowering developers to harness the potential 
of emerging technologies, furthering the growth and innovation in the field of circuit design, IoT, and TinyML.
