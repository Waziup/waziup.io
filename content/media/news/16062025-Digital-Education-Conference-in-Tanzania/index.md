**Dar es Salaam, Tanzania , May 7–9, 2025**

Waziup participated in the 18th International Conference & Exhibition on Digital Education, Training & Skills Development, held under the theme *Re-imagining Education and Human Capital Development for Africa's Future Prosperity*. The conference brought together education leaders, innovators, development partners, and digital transformation advocates to shape the future of education and workforce development across Africa.

Representing Waziup, our team had the opportunity to showcase **WaziLab as a Service**, an inclusive and scalable digital learning platform designed to support hands-on education in TVET institutions and universities. This solution aligns with the conference’s focus on integrating digital literacy, artificial intelligence, and green skills into curricula, aiming to prepare a future-ready African workforce.

The event provided a strategic platform for networking and partnership development. Waziup engaged with multiple stakeholders and notably built valuable connections with Finnish organizations, setting the stage for promising future collaborations in advancing digital education technologies.

As an active member of the **Digital for Development (D4D) Hub**, Waziup also connected with the **D4D African Directorate**, exchanging insights and showcasing past initiatives implemented across the continent.
