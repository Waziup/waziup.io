The **SEADE Project** has successfully concluded its **Digital Youth Program**, held from **April 7–11**, 2025, bringing together passionate youth from **Kenya and Tanzania** for a dynamic week of **IoT, innovation, and entrepreneurship training**.

The program kicked off with an engaging pitching session, where teams presented tech-driven solutions addressing regional challenges. These sessions served as both inspiration and insight into the potential of youth-led innovation across East Africa.

Participants then engaged in intensive **technical training**—delivered via the **WaziLab platform**—covering IoT hardware, WaziCloud, communication protocols, and real-time application using the **Waziup Solution Box**. Training took place virtually and at local innovation hubs, fostering hands-on experience and peer collaboration.

The curriculum expanded into web and app development, end-device integration, and business strategy, enabling participants to transform prototypes into scalable, market-ready products.

This initiative marks a powerful step in SEADE’s mission to foster digital transformation and build a new generation of innovators equipped with the tools to drive sustainable impact in their communities.

Stay connected as SEADE continues to scale innovation across the region!
