## Waziup e.V. Announces KijaniSpace Project, a Horizon Europe-Funded Partnership for Africa-EU Agricultural Innovation

Waziup e.V. is thrilled to announce the launch of KijaniSpace, an ambitious new project funded by Horizon Europe and dedicated to advancing agriculture through the Africa-EU partnership. Bringing together 13 partners from across Europe (Germany, Czech Republic, Switzerland, and Finland) and Africa (Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania), this initiative aims to address pressing agricultural challenges and promote sustainable development through cutting-edge technology.

Over the next three years, KijaniSpace will leverage EU Space technologies, IoT, and Earth Observation tools to enhance both fish farming and crop farming practices across Africa. The project draws on expertise from multiple sectors to support smallholder farmers, build resilience against climate impacts, and increase productivity with precision agriculture techniques.

This cross-continental collaboration is made possible thanks to EUSPA - EU Agency for the Space Programme, our Project Officer Manuel Lopez-Martinez, and project coordinator InnoTec21 GmbH. Their support underscores the significance of bridging technology with agriculture to empower communities and create sustainable impacts.
