## Waziup and ACEIoT Empower African Innovators with IoT Rapid Application Course in Rwanda

Waziup in collaboration with African center of Excellence in Internet of Things (ACEIoT), recently organized an incredible 5-day course on IoT rapid application prototyping in Rwanda. The event was a smashing success, with 40 talented students from 5 different African countries coming together to participate in the cutting - edge training program. 
The opening ceremony was led by the ICT ministry of Rwanda followed by presentations from  The SmartAfrica initiative, Smart City Innovation, the Rwanda Development Board, and other international donors.
Over the course of the training, the students were tasked with developing prototypes for IoT based solutions to social problems in their communities. They worked in teams, using WAZIUP technologie to bring their ideas to life. In just three days, the students developed nine (9) initial prototypes and delivered impressive pitches for their social innovations.
The workshop was a resounding success, with certificates awarded to those who completed the course with flying colors. Looking forward, WAZIUP and ACEIoT plan to sign a Memorandum of Understanding for future collaborations, furthering the mission to bring cutting- edge IoT technologies to Africa and empower the next generation of innovators.
